//constructor:
//A constructor is a member function of a class that has the same name as the class name.
// It helps to initialize the object of a class.
//It is called whenever an instance of the class is created.
// It can be defined manually with arguments or without arguments.


//destructor:
//deconstructor is also a member function of a class that has the same name as the class name preceded by a tilde(~) operator.
// It helps to deallocate the memory of an object.
//It is called while object of the class is freed or deleted.
